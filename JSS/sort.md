Great focus 👌 Master Prabha — `Array.sort()` is one of the **most misunderstood** functions in JS. Let’s break it fully:

---

# 🔹 How `sort()` Works

* By default, `arr.sort()` **converts elements to strings** and compares them by **Unicode (dictionary order)**.

```js
[10, 2, 30].sort(); // ["10","2","30"] => [10, 2, 30]
```

👉 That’s why numbers get messed up.

To fix this, we pass a **compare function**:

```js
arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
```

---

# 🔹 Compare Function `(a, b)`

* If it returns **negative** → `a` comes before `b`
* If it returns **positive** → `b` comes before `a`
* If it returns **0** → no change

So:

```js
(a - b) < 0  → a < b → keep ascending
(a - b) > 0  → a > b → swap them
```

---

# 🔹 Ascending Sort

```js
let arr = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
console.log(arr); // [1, 5, 10, 25, 40, 100]
```

---

# 🔹 Descending Sort

```js
let arr = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
arr.sort((a, b) => b - a);
console.log(arr); // [100, 40, 25, 10, 5, 1]
```

---

# 🔹 Internal Working (Step by Step)

Imagine `arr = [3, 1, 4]`
and we do `arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);`

1. JS picks two elements to compare (say `3` and `1`).
2. Calls compare: `(3 - 1) = 2` → positive → swap them.

   * Array becomes `[1, 3, 4]`
3. Next compare `3` and `4`.
4. `(3 - 4) = -1` → negative → keep order.

   * Array stays `[1, 3, 4]`
5. Done → sorted ascending.

---

# 🔹 Important Notes

* `sort()` **mutates** the array (changes original).
* Sorting **strings** works fine without compare function:

```js
["banana", "apple", "cherry"].sort(); 
// ["apple","banana","cherry"]
```

* Sorting **objects** requires custom comparator:

```js
let people = [
  {name: "Prabha", age: 22},
  {name: "John", age: 30},
  {name: "Asha", age: 18}
];

people.sort((a,b) => a.age - b.age);
// [{Asha,18},{Prabha,22},{John,30}]
```

---

✅ **Summary**

* Ascending → `(a, b) => a - b`
* Descending → `(a, b) => b - a`
* Internally: JS repeatedly compares pairs → swaps if needed → final sorted array

---

Got it 👌 — let’s take a **bigger sample array with 7 elements** and walk step by step how `arr.sort((a, b) => a - b)` works internally.

⚠️ Note: The actual sorting algorithm in JS can vary (V8 uses **Timsort**), but the **idea of compare & swap** is the same. I’ll illustrate with a **bubble sort style walk-through**, since it’s easiest to visualize.

---

## Example

```js
let arr = [50, 20, 70, 10, 40, 60, 30];
arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
```

---

## Step-by-Step (Bubble Sort Style)

We compare neighbors one by one:

### Pass 1

* Compare 50 & 20 → (50 - 20 = 30 > 0) → swap → `[20, 50, 70, 10, 40, 60, 30]`
* Compare 50 & 70 → (50 - 70 = -20 < 0) → keep
* Compare 70 & 10 → (70 - 10 = 60 > 0) → swap → `[20, 50, 10, 70, 40, 60, 30]`
* Compare 70 & 40 → swap → `[20, 50, 10, 40, 70, 60, 30]`
* Compare 70 & 60 → swap → `[20, 50, 10, 40, 60, 70, 30]`
* Compare 70 & 30 → swap → `[20, 50, 10, 40, 60, 30, 70]`

👉 Largest element `70` has bubbled to the end.

---

### Pass 2

* Compare 20 & 50 → keep
* Compare 50 & 10 → swap → `[20, 10, 50, 40, 60, 30, 70]`
* Compare 50 & 40 → swap → `[20, 10, 40, 50, 60, 30, 70]`
* Compare 50 & 60 → keep
* Compare 60 & 30 → swap → `[20, 10, 40, 50, 30, 60, 70]`

👉 Now `[20,10,40,50,30,60,70]`

---

### Pass 3

* Compare 20 & 10 → swap → `[10, 20, 40, 50, 30, 60, 70]`
* Compare 20 & 40 → keep
* Compare 40 & 50 → keep
* Compare 50 & 30 → swap → `[10, 20, 40, 30, 50, 60, 70]`
* Compare 50 & 60 → keep

👉 Now `[10,20,40,30,50,60,70]`

---

### Pass 4

* Compare 20 & 40 → keep
* Compare 40 & 30 → swap → `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]`
* Remaining are already in order.

---

✅ Final Sorted Array:

```
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
```

---

# 🔹 Key Takeaways

* Each compare `(a-b)` decides whether to swap.
* Negative → keep order, Positive → swap.
* After enough passes, the array is sorted.
* Actual JS uses **Timsort** (hybrid of merge sort + insertion sort), but **comparison logic is the same**.
